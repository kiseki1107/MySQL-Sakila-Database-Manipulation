# Data Manipulation in MySQL Using the Sakila Database
[Sakila](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/sakila/en/sakila-installation.html), a sample database provided by [MySQL](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/), is queried in this repository for data manipulation and data cleaning purposes.

This [file](https://github.com/kiseki1107/MySQL-Sakila-Database-Manipulation/blob/master/SQL%20hwk.sql) showcases common SQL queries ranging from SELECT, GROUP BY, and ORDER BY statements to more complex sub-queries and JOIN statements.
